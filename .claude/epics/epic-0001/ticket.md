# Claude Code Feature Testing Suite

Create a set of tests for claude code features to understand how they work, how reliable they are and understand the feature patterns. We need to test, claude.md, skills, rules, hooks, compact and most important, compare what we write with what is sent and the back and forth. We are using a hook to use our knowledge, we need to consider it.
