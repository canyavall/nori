# Project Selector - First Screen

First screen the user sees when opening Nori is a project selector. A project selector allows the user to create a new project or open an existing one. A project is a local folder where the user must have a .nori folder and inside the .nori a .settings (we will emulate how .claude in claude code and .opencode in opencode works) The user can create a new project, it opens a window where user can select a local folder and then scan a .nori folder, if not, creates it. Then, store in the user settings all projects created (at the end select a project is just open the terminal/chat in that location with those settings. The knowledge will be stored inside .nori/knowledge. We will have a debug mode in Nori where we can store tracking data inside .nori/debug
