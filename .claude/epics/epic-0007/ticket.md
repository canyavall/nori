# Migrate Nori from Tauri/Rust backend to Node.js/TypeScript backend

Migrate Nori from Tauri/Rust backend to Node.js/TypeScript backend while preserving React frontend. Goal: Replicate OpenCode's OAuth authentication approach and eliminate Rust build dependencies (CMake, NASM). Maintain all existing features: personality system, knowledge management, session persistence, hooks execution, workspace/vault management.
