# Two-Track Strategy

Dual-track strategy for immediate MCP solutions and long-term knowledge platform development. Includes ROI analysis and implementation phases.

## The Two Problems

**Problem 1: Dev Workflow (4 weeks)**
- Tool: Claude Code (proprietary)
- Users: Developers
- Goal: Dynamic knowledge loading for 150+ files
- Solution: MCP Server

**Problem 2: Company Knowledge Platform (Years)**
- Tool: OpenCode (open source)
- Users: PO, Devs, QA, Architects, Business
- Goal: Institutional knowledge that compounds
- Solution: Custom OpenCode deployment

## Track 1: MCP Server for Claude Code

Build Model Context Protocol server for knowledge loading.

**How it works**:
```
1. Read ticket
2. Call MCP tool: load_knowledge(tags: ["auth", "api"])
3. Receive knowledge content
4. Execute with full context
```

**Timeline**: 1 week to build + test
**Cost**: Minimal (just MCP development)

## Track 2: OpenCode Knowledge Platform

**Vision**: Everyone's work becomes AI knowledge

**Knowledge compounds**:
- Year 0: 0 files, $0 value
- Year 1: 500 files, $200k value (onboarding savings)
- Year 2: 2000 files, $900k value (efficiency gains)
- Year 3: 5000 files, $2M+ value (competitive moat)

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Phase 1: Dev Team Pilot (3 months) → 100-200 files
2. Phase 2: Cross-functional (6 months) → 500-1000 files
3. Phase 3: Company-wide (Ongoing) → 2000-5000+ files

## Why OpenCode Over Custom

- Cost: $50k-100k vs $200k-500k for custom
- Time: 3-6 months vs 12-18 months
- Risk: Low (proven) vs High (custom)
- Maintenance: Shared with community

## Critical Success Factors

**Executive Buy-in**: Pitch institutional memory value
**Contribution Incentives**: Make it part of workflow, not extra step
**Quality Governance**: Metrics for completeness, freshness, usage
**Measure Impact**: Track onboarding time, decision speed, code quality

## ROI Summary

**Total investment**: ~$300k over 3 years
**Total value**: $2M-5M (6-16× ROI)
