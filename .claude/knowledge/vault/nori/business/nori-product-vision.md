  Nori product vision and strategy: knowledge-first AI collaboration platform for
  cross-functional teams (Engineers, PMs, POs, Architects, CISO, SRE) with visual
  knowledge management and role-based personalities

# Nori Product Vision

Knowledge-first AI collaboration platform designed for entire product teams, not just engineers.

## Vision Statement

**Enable cross-functional teams to leverage Claude AI through role-specific personalities and visible, curated knowledge systems.**

## Problem Being Solved

**Current AI coding tools (Claude Code, OpenCode):**
- Terminal-based (intimidates non-engineers)
- No role differentiation (same interface for PO and Engineer)
- Hidden knowledge systems (no visibility into what AI "knows")
- No knowledge curation tools (can't browse/edit/create knowledge)
- Single-user focused (no team collaboration)

**Pain points:**
1. PMs/POs can't use AI coding tools (too technical)
2. Knowledge is invisible ("Why did AI suggest this?")
3. No knowledge reuse (same questions answered repeatedly)
4. Role confusion (AI acts like engineer even for business questions)
5. No collaboration (can't share knowledge across team)

## Core Differentiators

1. **Cross-functional users**: PMs, POs, Architects, not just engineers
2. **Visual knowledge system**: Browse, search, edit, create packages via GUI
3. **Role-based personalities**: Different AI behavior for different roles
4. **Knowledge visibility**: Always see what knowledge is loaded
5. **Desktop app**: GUI, not terminal-based

## Target Users

**Primary roles:**
- Product Owner (PO)
- Architect (Staff Engineer)
- Engineer (FE/BE)
- CISO (Security)
- Infra/SRE

**Target companies:**
- Software product teams (50-500 people)
- 40% engineers, 60% other roles

## Product Positioning

**vs Claude Code:**
- Nori: Desktop GUI for all roles
- Claude Code: Terminal for engineers

**vs OpenCode:**
- Nori: Visual knowledge management
- OpenCode: Hidden knowledge system

**vs Cursor:**
- Nori: Knowledge-first, cross-functional
- Cursor: IDE-embedded, engineer-focused

## Value Proposition

**For individuals:**
"Use Claude AI with role-appropriate personality and visible knowledge"

**For teams:**
"Build institutional AI knowledge that compounds over time, accessible to entire product org"

## Competitive Moat

**Competitors can copy code. They CANNOT copy thousands of curated knowledge packages.**

Knowledge compounds:
- Linear cost (storage, maintenance)
- Exponential value (more knowledge = better AI decisions)
- Network effects (more users = more knowledge)

## MVP Scope

**Must have:**
- Role switcher (5 roles)
- Knowledge browser (visual tree, search)
- Knowledge editor (create/edit packages)
- Chat interface (Claude SDK)
- Knowledge visibility (show loaded packages)
- Custom hooks (any language)

**Not in MVP:**
- Remote sync (local-only)
- Multi-window (single window)
- Jobs/parallelization
- Team features

## Success Metrics

**MVP (Month 4):**
- 100 active users
- 50%+ using non-engineer roles
- 500+ knowledge packages created

**V1.0 (Month 8):**
- 1,000 active users
- 10 paying customers
- $10K MRR

## Go-to-Market

**Phase 1: Open source launch**
- Product Hunt
- Hacker News
- Reddit developer communities

**Phase 2: Freemium**
- Free: Local-only, 10 packages
- Pro ($20/mo): Unlimited, remote sync

**Phase 3: Enterprise**
- Team features
- SSO, compliance
- $50/user/mo

## Why Now?

1. AI adoption exploding (teams need tools for non-engineers)
2. Knowledge management unsolved (no visual AI knowledge curation)
3. Claude is SOTA (72.7% SWE-bench)
4. Tauri 2.0 ready (modern desktop framework)
5. We have domain expertise (41 knowledge packages built)
