# Nori Business Model

Nori knowledge platform business model and value proposition. Includes market positioning, competitive moat, and growth strategy.

## Value Proposition

**For Developers**: Dynamic knowledge loading eliminates context overload, enables 150+ knowledge files with tag-based selective loading

**For Organizations**: Institutional knowledge platform where everyone's work becomes AI-accessible knowledge, compounding value over time

## Product Strategy

**Nori as Claude Code Enhancement**: Open-source OpenCode fork optimized exclusively for Anthropic/Claude models

**Key Differentiators**:
- Native Claude optimization (removes 15+ AI providers)
- Advanced knowledge management system
- Tag-based dynamic loading via MCP
- Clean-room implementation of Claude Code patterns

## Competitive Moat

**Competitors can copy code. They CANNOT copy 5000+ knowledge files of domain expertise.**

**Knowledge compounds exponentially**:
- Linear cost (storage, maintenance)
- Exponential value (more knowledge = better AI decisions)
- Network effects (more users = more knowledge = better platform)

## Market Positioning

**Immediate Market**: Developers using Claude Code needing better knowledge management

**Long-term Market**: Organizations wanting institutional memory as AI-accessible knowledge

**Pricing Strategy** (Future):
- Free: Core OpenCode fork (open source)
- Paid: MCP servers, enterprise features, hosted platform
- Enterprise: Custom deployment, knowledge governance, access controls

## Growth Strategy

**Year 1**: Open source release, developer adoption, MCP marketplace
**Year 2**: Enterprise pilots, knowledge platform SaaS
**Year 3**: Market leader in AI-enhanced institutional knowledge

## Key Metrics

**Adoption**: GitHub stars, npm downloads, active installations
**Engagement**: Knowledge files created, queries served, cache hit rate
**Value**: Onboarding time reduction, decision speed improvement, code quality metrics
**Revenue** (Future): MCP subscriptions, enterprise licenses, support contracts

## Strategic Advantages

**Open Source**: Community contributions, transparency, trust
**Claude Native**: Best-in-class integration with leading AI
**Knowledge First**: Built around knowledge management, not bolted on
**Clean Room**: Legal defensibility, no IP violations
